## üìåAbout Me

I am Himanshu M Chaudhari, an Embedded Systems trainee with strong programming skills in C, C++, Embedded C, and Data Structures. Currently training at Vector India, Hyderabad, I‚Äôm working extensively with microcontrollers like ARM7 (LPC2129/LPC2148), 8051 and gaining in-depth knowledge of embedded hardware and software integration.

My focus areas include real-time operating systems (RTOS), Linux-based development, and communication protocols such as CAN, SPI, I2C, and UART. I enjoy problem-solving and continuously seek to improve system efficiency and reliability. My dedication to learning and building practical solutions is driven by a passion for coding, electronics, and system interfacing.

I‚Äôm looking forward to contributing to innovative embedded technology projects and growing in a challenging, fast-paced environment that values creativity and technical depth.

## MAJOR PROJECTS

__Module C, DSA, Embedded C, Linux, ARM7(LPC2148) & Protocols : DYNAMIC OTP-DRIVEN SECURE ACCESS SYSTEM___

__Objective:__ To architect and implement a Dynamic OTP‚ÄëDriven Secure Access System that delivers time‚Äësensitive, single‚Äëuse passcodes (OTP) to authenticate users against a protected backend, integrating strong cryptography, delivery flexibility, and robust system design, all while aligning with security best practices. Key components.


__Project Overview:__\
The system consists of two main components: \
__1. Front-End [Microcontroller (LPC2148) side]:__\
Acts like a real OTP Dynamic One-Time Password Generation:
 - Input Interface: User enters a password or request via keypad or serial/UART input.
 - Shared Secret / Seed: A stored token (counter, time-sync value, or key) within flash or NVRAM.
 - OTP Computation: Implement HOTP-like (counter-based) or TOTP-like (time-based) logic using HMAC‚ÄëSHA1/SHA256, possibly in software. This dynamic 6-digit OTP is generated per interaction.
 - Output: Displayed via LCD, UART, or transmitted via GSM/serial to remote device.
 - Verification Mechanism: Server or second microcontroller recalculates expected OTP and verifies match.
__2. Back-End [PC (Linux) side Application in C]:__\
Simulates a otp system:
 - Load user data: base32 secret, last-used timestep, retry count.
 - Request input: USER_ID, OTP, OPERATION (via CLI or socket).
 - Compute TOTP based on current UNIX time / 30‚ÄØs.
 - Validate OTP:
Check that it matches generated code.
Ensure it's not already used (compare timestep).
If OK:
Mark current timestep used.
Reset retry count.
Print ‚ÄúACCESS GRANTED‚Äù; log success.
If invalid:
Increment retry count; lockout if exceeded.
Log failure and reject.
Each attempt is logged: timestamp, user ID, provided OTP, operation, and result.

__Learning Keys:__
 - HOTP (counter-based): Uses a shared secret and a synchronized counter between client and server. Each successful authentication increments the counter. Allows look‚Äëahead to handle out‚Äëof-sync counters
 - HMAC hashing: OTPs are produced by applying a keyed-hash message authentication code (SHA‚Äë1 or SHA‚Äë256) to the secret + counter (for HOTP) or time window (for TOTP), followed by dynamic truncation of output bits to derive a 6-digit code 
 - Single-use enforcement: Once an OTP is used, it must not be accepted again, even within the same time window or counter value. Replay protection must be enforced.
 - Base32 encoding: Secrets are stored in base32 format and decoded before OTP generation. Compatibility with standard authenticator apps and libraries is easier this way 
 - Comprehensive event logging: Log all OTP-related events‚Äîattempts, success or failure, timestamp, user ID, operation context‚Äîfor diagnostics and compliance.
 - liboath (oathtool): A widely used C library that supports TOTP/HOTP and integrates easily into Linux/C applications 
 - For critical operations like transactions, consider using OCRA (Challenge‚ÄëResponse OTP, RFC 6287) where the OTP is tied to contextual data (e.g. amount, account) for stronger security.
 - Metacognition: Be aware of your own thinking‚Äîplan, monitor your understanding, adjust strategies as needed. Examples include self-questioning, visualization, and reflection
 - Keil uVision & Flash Magic: Practiced embedded development cycle: code > compile > flash > test using LPC2148.
 - GCC & Linux Terminal Usage: Compiled and debugged C programs on Linux, improving command-line confidence.
 - Embedded-Desktop System Integration:  Understood complete flow of embedded system communicating with a software database.
 - Modular Code Architecture: Separated logic into reusable modules (RFID, keypad, LCD, UART, banking logic).
 - Debugging & Troubleshooting: Gained skills in tracing serial data issues, peripheral mismatches, and logical errors.
 - Real-Time Application Thinking: Developed understanding of real-world system behavior, user access security, and fault-tolerance.
